## Celebrating 100 Years of RSS


Being part of the Akhila Bharateeya Pratinidhi Sabha 2025 has been an unforgettable experience. This year marks the centenary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and I couldn't be more grateful to contribute to this historic milestone. Over the past six days, I've felt a deep sense of purpose and pride, soaking in the energy and inspiration all around me.

## A Moment I'll Never Forget {#a-moment-ill-never-forget}
One memory that stands out — and probably will for the rest of my life — is when Param Poojaneeya Sri Mohan Bhagavat Ji personally greeted me. That moment is etched in my mind. It's not every day that you receive a salutation from someone who has dedicated his life to selfless service. Truly humbling!

## My Transformation Journey {#my-transformation-journey}
Looking back, RSS has played a massive role in my personal growth. I used to be a procrastinator — often unproductive and lacking purpose. Today, I can proudly say I've become more energetic, disciplined, and self-motivated. RSS gave me a sense of belonging and pushed me to evolve into a responsible leader.

## The Ironic Beauty of Service {#the-ironic-beauty-of-service}
One of the most striking aspects of the Sabha is the people you meet. Picture this: top engineers, data scientists, doctors, and experts in various fields — all here to serve. And who are they serving? Pracharaks who have renounced the comforts of a conventional career to devote their lives to the nation.

It's a beautiful irony. Some of the sharpest minds, leaders in their industries, stand in awe of these selfless individuals who may have little material wealth but possess an unshakable spirit of service. The wisdom and humility of the Pracharaks are a constant reminder that true leadership is about giving, not gaining.

## Moving Forward with Gratitude {#moving-forward-with-gratitude}
As I continue this journey, I carry with me invaluable lessons in selflessness, dedication, and commitment. This experience has further ignited my determination to contribute to society while growing as an individual.

To anyone who has ever wondered what it means to find purpose, I say — give yourself the opportunity to serve. You'll be amazed at how much it changes you.

### Bharat Mata Ki Jai!
