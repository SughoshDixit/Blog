## Introduction
While mean and variance tell us about the center and spread of data, [skewness](/key) and [kurtosis](/key) reveal the shape of the distribution. Understanding these shape features helps us choose appropriate methods for outlier detection, binning, and modeling.

**TL;DR:**

[Skewness](/key) tells you if data lean left or right (asymmetry). ↩↪

[Kurtosis](/key) tells you how heavy the tails are (how many extremes you see).

Two datasets can share the same mean and variance but look completely different — shape features reveal the hidden story.

Knowing shape helps you choose better [outlier](/key) rules, bins, and models.

## 1. What "shape features" mean
The mean says where your data live.

The variance says how spread out they are.

But the shape — captured by skewness and kurtosis — says what personality your data have.

Think of:

**Skewness** = tilt or lean

**Kurtosis** = tail weight (heaviness of extremes)

Same center + same spread ≠ same shape.

One can be tall and thin, another flat and wide, another lopsided — and each tells a different story.

## 2. [Skewness](/key) = Asymmetry ↩↪
<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>

**Positive skew (right-skewed):** long tail to the right — a few large values pull the distribution.

**Negative skew (left-skewed):** long tail to the left — a few small values drag it down.

**Near zero skew:** roughly symmetric.

**Quick mental check:**
* Mean > Median → Right skew
* Mean < Median → Left skew

**How it's computed (idea):**

Skewness measures the average signed distance of points from the mean, scaled by their spread.

You don't need to calculate it manually — just know it quantifies tilt.

**Where it matters:**
* Amounts, durations, and counts are often right-skewed.
* Strong skew breaks "normality" assumptions and messes with classical z-scores.

## 3. [Kurtosis](/key) = Tail Weight
<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>

**High kurtosis (leptokurtic):** heavy tails → many extremes.

**Low kurtosis (platykurtic):** light tails → few extremes.

**Normal distribution has kurtosis = 3.**

"Excess kurtosis" = kurtosis − 3 → Normal ⇒ 0 excess.

**Myth alert:** Kurtosis is about tails, not peakedness.

You can have a tall center and still light tails —or a flat center with heavy tails.

**Practical impact:**
* Heavy tails → Mean/SD get distorted; use Median/MAD and robust z-scores.
* Light tails → Classic mean/SD methods behave predictably.

## 4. Why You Should Care
**Outlier Detection:**
* Right-skew + heavy tails → use robust stats (Median/MAD).
* Symmetric + light tails → classical z-score is fine.

**Binning and Percentiles:**
* Skewed data → prefer quantile bins over equal-width.

**Modeling Implications:**
* Skewness → consider log/sqrt transforms for variance stability.
* High kurtosis → expect many extremes → try quantile loss or robust regressions.

Use shape diagnostics like `get_skewness_kurtosis()` to guide cleaning, binning, and feature selection.

## 5. Three Shapes, Same Mean & Variance
Imagine three histograms with the same mean and variance:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Shape</th>
<th>Skewness</th>
<th>Kurtosis</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Symmetric light-tailed</td>
<td>≈ 0</td>
<td>&lt; 3</td>
<td>Bell-shaped, few extremes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Symmetric heavy-tailed</td>
<td>≈ 0</td>
<td>&gt; 3</td>
<td>Frequent highs and lows</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Right-skewed</td>
<td>&gt; 0</td>
<td>&gt; 3</td>
<td>Many small values, few big ones</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

All have identical center and spread — but completely different risk and outlier profiles.

## 6. Histogram Cheat Sheet
* Tail longer on right → **Positive skew**
* Tail longer on left → **Negative skew**
* Fat tails → **High kurtosis**
* Slim tails → **Low kurtosis**

Visual cue = instant intuition.

## 7. Typical Ranges (Quick Rules)
**Skewness:**
* |skew| < 0.5 → roughly symmetric
* 0.5–1 → mild skew
* |skew| > 1 → strong skew

**Excess Kurtosis (kurtosis − 3):**
* < 0 → lighter tails than Normal
* ≈ 0 → about Normal
* > 0 → heavier tails than Normal

Use these as guides, not laws. Context is king.

## 8. Tiny Examples
**Right-skewed:** `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10]` → mean > median → skew > 0.

**Heavy tails:** `[−10, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 10]` → more extremes → high kurtosis.

Same spread, different story.

## 9. After Measuring Shape
* If skewed → use log/sqrt transforms (for positive data).
* For heavy tails → relax outlier cutoffs or use percentiles (5th/95th).
* Use robust methods (Median/MAD, quantile loss) for stability.
* Re-check skew/kurtosis after cleaning or transforming.

## Visual Ideas
Show three histograms (side by side):

1. Symmetric light-tailed

2. Symmetric heavy-tailed

3. Right-skewed

Annotate each with "Skewness sign" and "Kurtosis ↑ / ↓".

## ⏱ One-Minute Summary
* **Skewness** = direction and strength of tilt.
* **Kurtosis** = tail heaviness (extremes).
* Mean & variance alone can mislead — shape completes the picture.
* Knowing shape → better thresholds, bins, transforms, and models.

## Shape Checklist
Compute skewness & kurtosis for key features

Visualize histograms or ECDFs

If |skew| > 0.5 → transform or use robust methods

If excess kurtosis > 0 → expect extremes and adjust thresholds

Re-evaluate after cleaning

## Takeaway
Every dataset has a shape signature.

[Skewness](/key) and [kurtosis](/key) let you read it like a fingerprint — revealing tilt, tail, and trustworthiness.

They don't just decorate your summary table — they guide how you treat [outliers](/key), split bins, and choose models.

**Shape matters.**

And once you see it, you can't unsee it.
