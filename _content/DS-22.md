## The Problem: Measuring Overlap 📊

**Scenario:** You're comparing two fraud detection models (Model A and Model B).

**Questions:**
- How many cases did **both** models catch? (Overlap)
- How many cases did **only Model A** catch? (Unique to A)
- How many cases did **only Model B** catch? (Unique to B)
- How similar are the two models? (Similarity metric)

**Simple counting isn't enough.** You need set theory to answer these questions systematically! 🎯

## Set Theory Fundamentals: Building Blocks 🧱

### What is a Set?

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects (elements).

**Examples:**
- **Set A:** All fraud cases detected by Model A = `{case1, case2, case3, ...}`
- **Set B:** All fraud cases detected by Model B = `{case2, case3, case5, ...}`
- **Universal Set U:** All fraud cases = `{case1, case2, case3, case4, case5, ...}`

### Cardinality

**Cardinality** is the number of elements in a set.

**Notation:**
- `|A|` = size of set A (number of elements)
- `|B|` = size of set B (number of elements)

**Example:**
```
|A| = 1000  (Model A detected 1000 fraud cases)
|B| = 1200  (Model B detected 1200 fraud cases)
```

## Set Operations: Intersection and Union 🔄

### Intersection (A ∩ B)

**Definition:** The intersection of two sets contains elements that are in **both** sets.

**Notation:** `A ∩ B`

**Example:**
```
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}
```

**Cardinality:** `|A ∩ B|` = number of elements in both sets

**Interpretation:**
- For fraud detection: Cases caught by **both** models
- For thresholds: Events captured by **both** threshold settings
- For versions: Items changed in **both** versions

### Union (A ∪ B)

**Definition:** The union of two sets contains all elements that are in **either** set (or both).

**Notation:** `A ∪ B`

**Example:**
```
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

**Cardinality:** `|A ∪ B|` = number of elements in either set

**Interpretation:**
- For fraud detection: All cases caught by **either** model
- For thresholds: All events captured by **either** threshold
- For versions: All items changed in **either** version

**Visual Example:**

## Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: Computing Union Size 📐

### The Formula

**Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
```
|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
```

**Why subtract the intersection?**
- When adding |A| and |B|, elements in the intersection are **counted twice**
- Subtract |A ∩ B| to correct for the double-counting

**Example:**
```
|A| = 1000
|B| = 1200
|A ∩ B| = 700

|A ∪ B| = 1000 + 1200 - 700 = 1500
```

**Interpretation:**
- Model A caught 1000 cases
- Model B caught 1200 cases
- Both models caught 700 cases (overlap)
- **Total unique cases caught:** 1500

**Visual Example:**

## Venn Diagrams: Visualizing Set Relationships 📊

### What is a Venn Diagram?

A **Venn diagram** is a visual representation of set relationships using overlapping circles.

**Basic 2-Set Venn Diagram:**
- Two circles represent two sets
- Overlap represents intersection
- Non-overlapping regions represent unique elements

**Visual Example:**

<img src="/DS-22/venn_basic.png" alt="Basic Venn Diagram" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '1.5rem auto', borderRadius: '8px'}} />

### Venn Diagram with Counts

To make Venn diagrams useful, we annotate them with **cardinalities** (counts):

**Example:**
```
|A| = 1000
|B| = 1200
|A ∩ B| = 700

Venn Diagram Annotations:
- Only A: |A| - |A ∩ B| = 1000 - 700 = 300
- Only B: |B| - |A ∩ B| = 1200 - 700 = 500
- Both (Intersection): |A ∩ B| = 700
- Total (Union): |A ∪ B| = 1500
```

**Visual Example:**

<img src="/DS-22/venn_with_counts.png" alt="Venn Diagram with Counts" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '1.5rem auto', borderRadius: '8px'}} />

## Jaccard Index: Measuring Set Similarity 🎯

### What is the Jaccard Index?

The **Jaccard index** (also called Jaccard similarity coefficient) measures the similarity between two sets.

**Formula:**
```
J(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
```

**Properties:**
- Range: 0 to 1
- J = 0: No overlap (disjoint sets)
- J = 1: Complete overlap (identical sets)
- Higher J: More similar sets

**Example:**
```
|A| = 1000
|B| = 1200
|A ∩ B| = 700
|A ∪ B| = 1500

J(A, B) = 700 / 1500 = 0.467 ≈ 47%
```

**Interpretation:** The two sets share 47% of their combined elements.

**Visual Example:**

<img src="/DS-22/jaccard_index.png" alt="Jaccard Index Visualization" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '1.5rem auto', borderRadius: '8px'}} />

### When to Use Jaccard Index

**Perfect for:**
- Comparing model outputs
- Measuring threshold overlap
- Evaluating version differences
- Clustering similarity

**Not ideal for:**
- When one set is much larger than the other (skewed towards larger set)
- When absolute counts matter more than ratios

## Overlap Coefficient: Alternative Similarity Metric 📈

### What is the Overlap Coefficient?

The **overlap coefficient** (also called Szymkiewicz–Simpson coefficient) measures overlap relative to the **smaller set**.

**Formula:**
```
Overlap(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / min(|A|, |B|)
```

**Properties:**
- Range: 0 to 1
- Overlap = 0: No overlap
- Overlap = 1: Smaller set is completely contained in larger set
- More sensitive to the smaller set

**Example:**
```
|A| = 1000
|B| = 1200
|A ∩ B| = 700

Overlap(A, B) = 700 / min(1000, 1200) = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 = 70%
```

**Interpretation:** 70% of the smaller set (A) is covered by the larger set (B).

### Jaccard vs Overlap Coefficient

**Comparison:**
```
|A| = 100
|B| = 1000
|A ∩ B| = 80

Jaccard = 80 / (100 + 1000 - 80) = 80 / 1020 = 0.078 ≈ 8%
Overlap = 80 / min(100, 1000) = 80 / 100 = 0.80 = 80%
```

**Key Difference:**
- **Jaccard:** Normalized by union (both sets matter equally)
- **Overlap:** Normalized by smaller set (focuses on coverage of smaller set)

**When to use each:**
- **Jaccard:** When both sets are equally important
- **Overlap:** When you care about how much of the smaller set is covered

**Visual Example:**

## Exercise: Computing Jaccard and Overlap Coefficient 🎓

### The Problem

**Given triplet:** `(a, b, ab)` where:
- `a` = |A| = 1000 (cardinality of set A)
- `b` = |B| = 1200 (cardinality of set B)
- `ab` = |A ∩ B| = 700 (intersection size)

**Compute:**
1. Jaccard index
2. Overlap coefficient

### Solution

**Step 1: Calculate Union Size**

Using inclusion-exclusion principle:
```
|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
         = 1000 + 1200 - 700
         = 1500
```

**Step 2: Calculate Jaccard Index**

```
J(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
         = 700 / 1500
         = 0.467
         ≈ 46.7%
```

**Step 3: Calculate Overlap Coefficient**

```
Overlap(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / min(|A|, |B|)
              = 700 / min(1000, 1200)
              = 700 / 1000
              = 0.70
              = 70%
```

**Step 4: Interpret Results**

- **Jaccard = 46.7%:** The two sets share about 47% of their combined elements
- **Overlap = 70%:** 70% of the smaller set (A) is covered by set B

**Visual Example:**

<img src="/DS-22/exercise_solution.png" alt="Exercise Solution" style={{maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '1.5rem auto', borderRadius: '8px'}} />

### Python Implementation

```python
def compute_similarity_metrics(a, b, ab):
    """
    Compute Jaccard index and overlap coefficient
    
    Parameters:
    - a: |A| (cardinality of set A)
    - b: |B| (cardinality of set B)
    - ab: |A ∩ B| (intersection size)
    
    Returns:
    - dict with Jaccard and Overlap coefficients
    """
    # Calculate union
    union = a + b - ab
    
    # Calculate Jaccard index
    jaccard = ab / union if union > 0 else 0
    
    # Calculate overlap coefficient
    overlap = ab / min(a, b) if min(a, b) > 0 else 0
    
    return {
        'jaccard': jaccard,
        'overlap': overlap,
        'union': union
    }

# Example usage
result = compute_similarity_metrics(a=1000, b=1200, ab=700)
print(f"Jaccard Index: {result['jaccard']:.3f} ({result['jaccard']*100:.1f}%)")
print(f"Overlap Coefficient: {result['overlap']:.3f} ({result['overlap']*100:.1f}%)")
```

**Output:**
```
Jaccard Index: 0.467 (46.7%)
Overlap Coefficient: 0.700 (70.0%)
```

## Advanced: Three-Set Venn Diagrams 🔵🔵🔵

### Three Sets

When comparing **three sets** (A, B, C), the relationships become more complex:

**Regions:**
- Only A: `A - (B ∪ C)`
- Only B: `B - (A ∪ C)`
- Only C: `C - (A ∪ B)`
- A and B (not C): `(A ∩ B) - C`
- A and C (not B): `(A ∩ C) - B`
- B and C (not A): `(B ∩ C) - A`
- All three: `A ∩ B ∩ C`

**Inclusion-Exclusion for Three Sets:**
```
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| 
             - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| 
             + |A ∩ B ∩ C|
```

## Best Practices for Set Comparison Analysis ✅

### 1. Always Annotate Venn Diagrams

Include cardinalities for:
- Each set
- Intersections
- Unique regions
- Total union

### 2. Calculate Multiple Metrics

Don't rely on a single metric. Calculate:
- Jaccard index
- Overlap coefficient
- Absolute counts
- Relative percentages

### 3. Visualize Before Analyzing

Always create a Venn diagram to:
- Understand relationships visually
- Spot patterns quickly
- Communicate findings effectively

### 4. Consider Set Sizes

Be aware of:
- Size differences between sets
- Impact on similarity metrics
- Whether absolute or relative measures matter

### 5. Use Appropriate Metrics

Choose metrics based on your question:
- **Jaccard:** When both sets matter equally
- **Overlap:** When smaller set coverage matters
- **Absolute counts:** When volumes are critical

### 6. Document Your Sets Clearly

For each set, document:
- What it represents
- How it was created
- When it was captured
- Any filters applied
