## TL;DR
**From Cloud Analyst to Data Scientist at Oracle in just 5 years—proving that with grit, continuous learning, and unwavering determination, you can transform your career and achieve your dreams. This is the story of how I turned my passion into my profession, one step at a time.**


Five years ago, I put down my academic hat and stepped into the corporate world with curiosity, ambition, and a lot of uncertainty. I was fortunate to graduate with five job offers on the table—a privilege I don't take lightly. Among them, Oracle stood out. For me, it was nothing short of a dream company, and I proudly chose it as the starting point of my career.

## The Early Days {#the-early-days}

I began my journey as a Cloud Analyst. Truth be told, it wasn't exactly aligned with my passion. My heart was already set on Data Science, but at that moment, the role of a Data Analyst was the closest bridge I could find. Instead of feeling stuck, I made a decision—to persevere, learn, and create my own opportunities. **Sometimes, the path to your dreams isn't a straight line—it's about taking the first step, even if it's not perfect.**

Even after long office hours, I pushed myself to work on side projects, one of them being my personal blog. These small but consistent efforts kept me connected to what I truly loved. **The secret? Never let your day job define your dreams—let your dreams define your actions.**

*Those late nights and weekend projects that kept my passion for Data Science alive, even when my day job wasn't aligned with my dreams.*

## A Bold Step: Masters While Working Full-Time {#a-bold-step-masters-while-working-full-time}

In parallel, I decided to invest in myself and self-fund a Master's in Data Science & Engineering at BITS Pilani—all while continuing my day job at Oracle. **This wasn't just about getting a degree; it was about investing in my future, one weekend at a time.**

It meant sacrificing weekends, personal time, and comfort for two full years. It wasn't easy; balancing a demanding job and rigorous academics tested me in every way possible. But when I graduated in 2023, I realized those sacrifices had been stepping stones to something bigger. **The best investment you can make is in yourself—and the returns are limitless.**

*The countless hours of study, the weekend sacrifices, and the determination to invest in my future - all while maintaining excellence at work.*

## Growth at Oracle {#growth-at-oracle}

My first three years at Oracle Fusion HCM were invaluable. The colleagues, mentors, and team culture shaped me into a better professional and person. But I knew deep down that I wanted to transition into Data Science within Oracle itself.

The next six months were some of the toughest—countless internal interviews, rejections, and retries. Breaking into a Data Scientist role in a company as large as Oracle wasn't going to come easy. But persistence has its own reward. **Every 'no' is just a step closer to your 'yes'—never give up on your dreams, even when the path seems impossible.**

## Breaking Through {#breaking-through}

Finally, the opportunity came knocking: Data Scientist II at Oracle Finance. After rounds of rigorous interviews, I secured the role. That moment remains one of the most defining milestones of my career. **When preparation meets opportunity, magic happens—and that magic is called success.**

Today, I serve as the Product Owner of a niche Data Science product in the ML4AML (Machine Learning for Anti-Money Laundering) space. The work is complex, impactful, and exactly where I envisioned myself when I started this journey five years ago. **This is proof that when you align your actions with your aspirations, the universe conspires to help you achieve your goals.**
