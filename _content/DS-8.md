# **Day 8 — Adjusted Boxplot & Medcouple**

## Introduction
Regular [boxplots](/key) assume symmetric data, so a long tail looks suspicious. Real-world datasets—salaries, housing prices, reaction times—are often skewed. The adjusted boxplot fixes this by combining Tukey-style [fences](/key) with the [medcouple](/key), a robust skewness statistic.

**TL;DR:**
* [Medcouple](/key) measures skewness on a scale from **−1 → +1**.
* Adjusted [fences](/key) use exponential factors so the long tail gets extra space.
* Positively skewed data widens the upper fence and tightens the lower fence (and vice versa).
* Use adjusted boxplots when histograms look lopsided or domain knowledge says “long tail is normal”.

## The Problem with Regular Boxplots
Imagine company salaries: most lie between ₹40k–₹80k, yet one executive earns ₹1600k. A traditional [boxplot](/key) calls that an [outlier](/key) because it places equal weight on both tails. The result: normal tail behavior is mislabelled as noise.

### Why symmetric fences fail
* Traditional fences: `Lower = Q₁ − 1.5 × [IQR](/key)` and `Upper = Q₃ + 1.5 × IQR`
* Works brilliantly when the distribution is balanced.
* Breaks when a tail is naturally long—think incomes, clicks, insurance claims.

<p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#555'}}>Regular boxplots think “extreme on either side” is equally likely; skewed data disagrees.</p>

---

## Enter the Adjusted Boxplot
The adjusted boxplot tweaks Tukey’s fences with an exponential factor driven by the [medcouple](/key). More skew means more asymmetry in the allowable range.

### Smart guard analogy
* **Regular guard:** “Tall or short? Either way you look suspicious.”
* **Adjusted guard:** “Most folks are tall today; short people stand out more than tall ones.”

## Meet the Medcouple (MC)
The medcouple is a robust skewness statistic that compares symmetric pairs around the [median](/key). It ignores extreme values and captures how one tail spreads relative to the other.
* `MC ≈ 0` → roughly symmetric.
* `MC > 0` → positively skewed (long right tail).
* `MC < 0` → negatively skewed (long left tail).

```
MC = median of h(xᵢ, x)

where h(xᵢ, x) = ((x - median) - (median - xᵢ)) / (x - xᵢ)
```

> Robust means the statistic resists the influence of single extreme values—perfect for skewed data.

---

## How the Adjusted Fences Work
Traditional fences use a fixed multiplier. Adjusted fences multiply **1.5 × IQR** by an exponential function of the medcouple:

```
Lower fence = Q₁ − 1.5 × exp(−3.5 × MC) × [IQR](/key)
Upper fence = Q₃ + 1.5 × exp(+4.0 × MC) × [IQR](/key)
```
* **Positive MC (right skew):** `exp(+4.0 × MC)` explodes, stretching the upper fence; `exp(−3.5 × MC)` shrinks, tightening the lower fence.
* **Negative MC (left skew):** the behavior flips—lower fence loosens, upper fence tightens.

## Worked Example — House Prices
Dataset (₹ in thousands): `[150, 180, 200, 220, 250, 280, 320, 400, 650, 1200]`

```
[Q₁](/key) = 200,  [Q₂](/key) = 265,  [Q₃](/key) = 400
[IQR](/key) = 200
Medcouple ≈ 0.35 (right skew)
```

### Traditional fences
```
Lower = 200 − 1.5 × 200 = −100
Upper = 400 + 1.5 × 200 = 700 → flags 1200 as an outlier
```

### Adjusted fences
```
Lower = 200 − 1.5 × exp(−3.5 × 0.35) × 200 ≈ 112
Upper = 400 + 1.5 × exp(4.0 × 0.35) × 200 ≈ 1618
```

No [outliers](/key) detected  — the long right tail is normal for property values.

## Pseudocode Implementation
```
def adjusted_boxplot_outliers(data):
Q1, Q3 = compute_quartiles(data)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
MC = compute_medcouple(data)

lower = Q1 - 1.5 * math.exp(-3.5 * MC) * IQR
upper = Q3 + 1.5 * math.exp(4.0 * MC) * IQR

return [x for x in data if x < lower or x > upper]
```

> Tools like `adjusted_boxplot_outliers` in our toolkit automate the math while you focus on interpretation.

## When to Switch Boxplots
Use adjusted boxplots when:
* Histograms or [density](/key) plots reveal skewness.
* Domain knowledge screams “long tail is normal” (salaries, prices, insurance claims).
* Traditional boxplots call too many valid values outliers.

Stick with regular boxplots when:
* Data is roughly symmetric or sample size is tiny (&lt;20).
* You need a quick-and-dirty check for any extreme value.

---

##  Takeaway
* The [medcouple](/key) captures skewness without being tricked by outliers.
* Adjusted [boxplots](/key) expand and contract fences intelligently.
* Long tails stop masquerading as anomalies; true anomalies still pop.
