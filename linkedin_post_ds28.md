# LinkedIn Post for Day 28: Robust Imputation and Numeric Coercion

📅 Day 28 of my 30 Day Data Science Challenge — Data Preprocessing Impact

Chanakya says, "अद्भिर्गात्राणि शुध्यन्ति मनः सत्येन शुध्यति" (The body is cleansed by water, the mind is purified by truth). Just as purification is essential, data imputation cleanses raw inputs to reveal the true distribution!

**The Problem:**
Your pipeline receives:
- Missing values (NA, NULL, "")
- Mixed types ("100", 100, "N/A")
- Invalid entries ("error", -999)

**The Tool: Imputation Strategies 🩹**

**Zero Imputation:**
- Mean: ↓ Decreases
- Variance: ↑ Increases
- p50: ↓ Shifts left

**Mean Imputation:**
- Mean: = Preserved
- Variance: ↓ Decreases
- p50: ~ Compressed

**Median Imputation:**
- Mean: ~ Stable
- Variance: ↓ Decreases
- p50: = Preserved

**The Surprise:**

```
Original: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] → p50 = 30
After 20% zero imputation: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] → p50 = 25

27% shift in median threshold! 📉
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Thresholds based on quantiles move
- Decision boundaries shift in feature space
- Rule geometry changes fundamentally

**Bottom line:** Imputation isn't neutral. Zero imputation shifts distributions left, mean imputation reduces variance. Choose your strategy based on domain knowledge! 🔧
